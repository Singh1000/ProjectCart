To get the partially implemented application running locally:

1. Please run the springboot application and access http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

2. Using the /products POST endpoint, create some entries.

3. Please run `npm start` in the terminal from the ui folder to get the frontend
running and access http://localhost:4200 to see the ui.
4. Products added as part of step 2 should be rendered in the ui.

Although the endpoints for adding to the cart have been added, they haven't been integrated 
with the ui.
